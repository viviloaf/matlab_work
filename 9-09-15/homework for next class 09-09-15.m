function that makes

a[i j k]

b=[i j k]

into

c_i j = [(a_ i)*(b_ j)]


ex: a=[1, 2, 3]
ex: b=[3, 0.5, 0.6]

takes any a and b vectors into a c vecotr

example
c= [c11=a1*b1, c12=a1*b2, c13=a1*b3]
   [c21=a2*b1, c22=a2*b2, c23=a3*b2]
   [c31=a3*b1, c32=a3*b2, c33=a3*b3]
  
  
   use a=[1 2 3], b=[3, .5, .6]
   
   then create a general forumla to solve for any inputs
