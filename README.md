code dump of coursework from ME 1311 @ KSU

This is a coursework dump from my ME 1311 MATLAB for engineers class. The code is annonated so that a single file may have multiple scripts written into it.

This is mainly for personal preservation however it is open to your usage for examples of any MATLAB code.

I will be happy to re-interpret any of the code if you send me a message. Note the date it was created so I may not exactly remember what i was trying to do, however given the homework prompts that are spaced throughout, I will be able to figure it out
